We’re engaged
The proposal
With the cold winter approaching, Emma & Walter planned to spend a relaxing long weekend in Klagenfurt, Austria. On the 8th of December 2016, they drove up to the Austrian border; after a delightful lunch in Tarvisio they reached the Seepark Hotel, ready for Christmas markets, pool & sauna, good food and fun!
Walter organized a wonderful dinner at the fancy hotel restaurant. Both him and Emma got all dressed up, and they were just heading out of their hotel room when… Walter pulled out a BIG present, literally a BIG present.
As most of you know it was a snazzy and stylish handbag for work (Walter sure knows this girl’s taste!).
Emma had no time to actually thank her man for the gift, when he just said “Look inside” and all of a sudden he was on one knee and… well you know the rest ;-)

Historical background
The Villa dates back to the second half of the 17th century. In 1811 it was owned by the Redolfi family, landowners in Trivignano, at the time it was very different from today.
In 1821 Francesco Redolfi sold the whole property to the Venetian nobleman Domenico Rubini, from an ancient patrician family who had settled in Friuli in the middle of the 18th century. They owned mills and traded in precious silk fabrics that were exported to Vienna. 
Domenico expanded and beautified the villa according to the aesthetic and architectural dictates of the Venetian Villas established by Palladio in the 16th century: neo-classical features on the main façade, doric pillars in the central body, the central rose window crowned by three beautiful statues, the stone staircase with a double ramp that leads to the first floor, to name a few. 
Ionic columns and a fine statue from the “workshop” of Canova adorn the central hall, which is characterized by the so-called Empire style (second phase of Neoclassicism). Murano chandeliers and original pieces of furniture complete the villa’s Venitian style.
The farm buildings, for the pressing of grapes and winemaking, the storage of wheat and the breeding of silkworms, were no less important. 
In 1848, the property was inherited by Carlo Rubini (one of Domenico’s sons), who lived there with his English wife Emma Forbes and their three daughters (the surrounding park had a strong English influence over the years).
During the First World War, Trivignano was right in the war zone, and the villa was used as a military hospital.
In 1954 Elodia Orgnani Martina bought the property and it has remained in the family ever since and hosts events of all kinds, all year round.
